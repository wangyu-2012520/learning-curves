# learning-curves

This small execise / experiment is targetted to: 
- Implemented regularized linear regression to fit training data and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties
- Applying learning curve to visualising / diagnose bias-variance problems
- Implemented Polynomial regression to better fit training data and have both low training error and low validation error 
- Adjusting the regularization parameter
