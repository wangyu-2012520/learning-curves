# learning-curves

This small exercise / experiment is targeted to: 
- Implemented regularized linear regression to fit training data and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties
- Applying learning curve to visualizing / diagnose bias-variance problems
- Implemented Polynomial regression to better fit training data and have both low training error and low validation error 
- Adjusting the regularization parameter

Machine learning technique used in this small exercise: 
- splitting training set, cross validation set, and test set (cross validation set is used to find the best possible hypothesis)
- regularization (of linear regression)
- visualizing a learning curve by plotting training error and cross validation error as a function of training set size
- adjust / automated selection of regularization parameter lambda
